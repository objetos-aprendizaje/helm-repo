## Project dependencies (it can be configured to deploy with the chart or connect to external services) ##

# PostgreSQL is a core dependency of the project, serving as the primary database for storing all structured information. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for managing data, ensuring consistency and performance. The dependency can be deployed alongside the project chart or configured to connect to an external PostgreSQL instance, offering flexibility to adapt to different environments and infrastructure setups.

# Kafka is a key dependency of the project, acting as the central messaging system for managing platform output events. It enables reliable, high-throughput, and scalable event streaming, ensuring seamless communication between components and efficient processing of event data. The dependency can be deployed alongside the project chart or configured to connect to an external Kafka instance, providing flexibility to integrate with various environments and infrastructure setups.

  # Zookeeper is a supporting dependency of the project, required only when the Kafka chart deployment is enabled. It acts as a coordination service for Kafka, managing broker metadata, leader election, and maintaining the overall cluster state. Zookeeper ensures the reliability and consistency of the Kafka deployment, but it is not needed when connecting to an external Kafka instance, providing flexibility based on the chosen deployment strategy.
