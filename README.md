# Portal Objetos de Aprendizaje: helm-repo

## How to install this chart

1. **Add Helm Chart Repository:**

    ```bash
    helm repo add poa-repo https://objetos-aprendizaje.github.io/helm-repo/
    ```

2. **Create Namespace (if not exists):**

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace <namespace-name>
    ```

   Replace `<namespace-name>` with the desired name for the namespace.

3. **Create persistent volumes and secrets:**

   You must create persistent volumes and volume claims for persistent data in the installation, there are two required volumes by this application for public and protected data uploads. You can customize the persistent volume claim name by modifying chart values (keys `admin.existingPVClaimPublic` and `admin.existingPVClaimProtected`), the default expected pvc names are:
   `pvc-portal-objetos-aprendizaje-admin-public` and `pvc-portal-objetos-aprendizaje-admin-protected`

   By default this chart is going to deploy a postgresql installation aswell (unless disabling with `postgresql.enabled` key and configuring `postgresql.postgresqlHost` and `postgresql.postgresqlPort` keys) and their default expected pvc name is `postgresql.existingPVClaim`. In case that do you use an external postgresql instance, it is required that [pg_vector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension is enabled.

   There are also some manifest examples under [extra-manifest-examples folder](https://github.com/objetos-aprendizaje/helm-repo/tree/main/extra-manifest-examples) at this chart repository. Note that they are illustrative and using hostpath /tmp folder, so this is not intended to be used for production.

   For app secrets it is configured in the same way, the system will require the secrets `poa-postgresql-secret`, `poa-admin-appkey-secret`, `poa-web-appkey-secret`, `poa-admin-web-api-key-secret` and `poa-admin-saml2-sp-cert-secret` (unless changed names on values.yml). There are also [one manifest example](https://github.com/objetos-aprendizaje/helm-repo/tree/main/extra-manifest-examples/required-secrets.yaml) under extra-manifest-examples folder.

   For `poa-admin-appkey-secret` and `poa-web-appkey-secret` it needs to be a valid key generated with `php artisan key:generate` that will generate something similar to "base64:X/tI11778LT12XntodYdmSrpbtgh9WNzjmlfxBzu1bw=". In case that you don't want to install the laravel artisan console on your device, if you have a running pod for web or admin project, you can exec the command on these containers that already contains this CLI.

   For `poa-admin-saml2-sp-cert-secret` secret, it is possible to generate a new certificate issuing the following opnenssl commands (requires openssl and some other utilities like base64 and tr in a unix environment):
   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.der -outform DER
   openssl base64 -in private_key.der -out private_key_base64.txt
   tr -d '\n' < private_key_base64.txt > private_key_base64_no_newline.txt
   # For defining at secret in Kubernetes using data field
   base64 -i private_key_base64_no_newline.txt

   openssl req -new -key private_key.der -out csr.pem -subj "/C=ES/ST=Some-State/L=City/O=Internet Widgits Pty Ltd/OU=IT Department/CN=example.com"
   openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -signkey private_key.der -out certificate.der -outform DER -days 365
   openssl base64 -in certificate.der -out certificate_base64.txt
   tr -d '\n' < certificate_base64.txt > certificate_base64_no_newline.txt
   # For defining at secret in Kubernetes using data field
   base64 -i certificate_base64_no_newline.txt
   ```

4. **Install Helm Chart:**

   ```bash
   helm install <release-name> portal-objetos-aprendizaje --namespace <namespace-name>
   # To upgrade to latest version after install you should use upgrade instead of install
   helm upgrade <release-name> portal-objetos-aprendizaje --namespace <namespace-name>
   ```

   - Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.
   - Replace `<namespace-name>` with the name of the namespace where the release will be installed.

   ---

   It is also possible to customize this chart deployment by using a values.yaml file, check for all possible keys and default values at [./portal-objetos-aprendizaje/values.yaml](https://github.com/objetos-aprendizaje/helm-repo/blob/main/portal-objetos-aprendizaje/values.yaml)

   ```bash
   helm install <release-name> <chart-name> --namespace <namespace-name> -f values.yaml
   # To upgrade to latest version after install you should use upgrade instead of install
   helm upgrade <release-name> <chart-name> --namespace <namespace-name> -f values.yaml
   ```

   - Replace `<release-name>` with the desired name for the release.
   - Replace `<chart-name>` with the name of the Helm chart to be installed.
   - Replace `<namespace-name>` with the name of the namespace where the release will be installed.
   - Use `-f` flag followed by the path to your values file (e.g., `values.yaml`) to specify the configuration options for the Helm chart.

5. **Access to the platform**

   If everything goes well you should be able to login using the default admin user: `admin@admin.com` with password `12345678`.

   In case that do you want to load demo data into the platform you should start a exec session on portal-objetos-aprendizaje-admin pod and execute `php artisan db:seed`.

   5.1. **Access to non HTTP services deployed by helm chart**

      Both Kafka and PostgreSQL are services that can be optionally deployed using this chart or configuring the app to use external services already deployed. In case that they are deployed by using this helm chart internal services access is configured automatically through k8s services. In case that you want to expose them you should point external traffic to k8s service traffic. They are named in the following way (check [_helpers.tpl](./portal-objetos-aprendizaje/templates/_helpers.tpl) file to see how portal-objetos-aprendizaje.fullname is generated):

      - PostgreSQL: `{{ include "portal-objetos-aprendizaje.fullname" . }}-postgresql-service`
      - Kafka: `{{ include "portal-objetos-aprendizaje.fullname" . }}-kafka-service`

      The procedure to point external traffic to k8s service depends heavily on the k8s cluster deployment type and IngressClasses. Here are some references on how to implement on different scenarions:

      - Amazon EKS: Through Application Load Balancers. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/alb-ingress.html
      - Google Cloud Platform GKS: External Application Load Balancers. https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/load-balance-ingress
      - Traefik: Through IngressRouteTCP (https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/providers/kubernetes-crd/#kind-ingressroutetcp) and dedicated entrypoint (https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/routing/entrypoints/)
      - Nginx: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/user-guide/exposing-tcp-udp-services/


## Using FMNT client certificates

In order to use FMNT client certificates for authentication you need to setup a ingress route with higher priority for path `/certificate-access` that requests client certificate on SSL connection and redirect to service `{{ include "portal-objetos-aprendizaje.fullname" . }}-admin-service` (check [_helpers.tpl](./portal-objetos-aprendizaje/templates/_helpers.tpl) file to see how portal-objetos-aprendizaje.fullname is generated).

This request should include a header with client certificate pem content (without begin/end tags nor line breaks), by default the header used is called `X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert` but it can be changed by configuring value `admin.fmntCertHeader`.

There are some manifests examples using traefik in k8s cluster as the edge inbound load balancer to configure client certificate authentication and header pem binding to backend using `X-Forwarded-Tls-Client-Cert` header in the [fmnt-traefik-ingress.yaml](./extra-manifest-examples/fmnt-traefik-ingress.yaml) example file. The host used for this ingress should match with url setted up at `web.fmntLoginUrl` value option.

## Minimal System Requirements

A series of performance tests have been conducted on the platform. For these tests, container monitoring was implemented on the pre-production deployment using the cAdvisor tool.

Screenshots of the test results have been attached under [./docs folder](./docs), showing the containers that had the most substantial resource usage. To generate load on the system, a test data import script was used. According to discussions with Juan Antonio, the execution of this script involves inserting all types of elements, which results in resource usage higher than expected during a fresh instance, like the ones being prepared. Thus, it can be considered as the minimum requirements.

The tests were performed on a machine with the following technical specifications:
- **CPU**: 12 x AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor (this can help assess the performance of 1 core in the test node)
- **NVMe Disks**: SAMSUNG MZQLB960HAJR-00007 (advertised speed: 3200 MB/s)

### Components with Substantial Resource Usage

1. **Database** (PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension):
   - **CPU**:
     - Maximum usage did not exceed 300 millicores, stabilizing around 200 millicores. However, a **minimum of 1000 millicores** is recommended.
   - **Memory**:
     - Usage was around 250MB. A **minimum of 1GB** is recommended, as more memory will be needed as the data volume increases.

2. **Administration Portal**:
   - The data import load was carried out here, but components of the web portal and worker (for asynchronous tasks) could be scaled similarly. All components are proposed through the Laravel framework, with identical or very similar logic.
   - **CPU**:
     - An initial peak of 750 millicores was observed, which then stabilized around 600 millicores. Since this is already high usage, a **minimum of 500 millicores** might be a reasonable value.
   - **Memory**:
     - Usage stabilized around 150MB. A **minimum of 512MB** is recommended for this component.

### Testing Environment & Results

The resources mentioned above are the limits setted up in the development pre-production deployment. This environment has been used for performance testing, as well as for comparisons with other deployments.

- Tests conducted by navigating the platform with a user resulted in screen load times ranging from milliseconds to a couple of seconds, with CPU usage spikes around 300 millicores and maximum RAM usage reaching 300MB.
